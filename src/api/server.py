# ── Structured-parameter credential screen ───────────────────────────────────
# Why this runs before invoke() rather than inside a node:
#
# The framework's mandatory output gate scans every value of every node result
# for credential patterns, and the backbone's first node copies the structured
# parameters verbatim into its own result. So a credential-shaped string
# anywhere in them makes the FIRST node of the graph fail, before any template
# code runs. What the caller receives is an error status with the domain result
# withheld and no explanation — nothing names the parameter, the field, or the
# reason. On a hosted conversation the same context is replayed every turn, so
# the session never recovers on its own.
#
# The request cannot succeed either way. Refusing it here changes nothing about
# what is accepted; it changes an opaque failure into an actionable one.
#
# The screen calls the SAME detector the gate calls, on the SAME assembled
# object, so what this adapter refuses and what the gate blocks are one set by
# construction — there is no local pattern list that could drift from it.
# Scanning field by field composes exactly to scanning the whole mapping (the
# detector on a mapping is the union over its values), which is what lets the
# refusal name the offending field without widening or narrowing the match.
#
# Field NAMES are caller-controlled too, so a name is repeated back only when it
# is short and inert; anything else is reported by position. The rejected value
# and the matched text are never echoed, in the response or in the audit record.
